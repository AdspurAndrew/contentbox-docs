ContentBox 3 is a collection of more than 150 tickets resolved.  It has been a massive undertaking with some great resoluts.  Below we go through the major updates and feature improvements.

## ColdBox 4 
We have updated the entire core to leverage ColdBox 4 and modularity.  We have completely re-architected all modules to adhere to ColdBox 4 standards and rely on CommandBox CLI for package management and resolutions.  This update in itself is worth noting as it not only modularized even more ContentBox, but gave it a source code reduction and performance boosts.

## SSL Support
SSL support can now be found everywhere in ContentBox for both the UI and admin modules.  Users can even select specific pages for users to transition into or out of SSL for richer eCommerce or secure experiences.

## Internationalization
The majority of all modules have been now translated into English, Spanish, Italian, German and French.  There is still work to do to localize the entire source, but it is coming.


## Admin UI
The administration module sports a completely re-designed responsive UI.  Our goal was to think mobile first and build from there.  So you will see tons of great additions for working on mobile devices, new editors, new fullscreen mdoes and much much more.

## Auto Save
We have introduced local storage auto saving capabilities for all editors in ContentBox.  No matter the implementation, we will provide auto-save capabilities.  This is a great way to know that silently your work is secure.

## Responsive Previews
All live previews are now responsive.  Meaning you can choose from the responsive previewer the type of device and get immediate feedback of the content result in real-time.
