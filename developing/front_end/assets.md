# Managing Assets

By default the `includes` directory of your theme is used to store your static assets.  

Because these assets are called from your customized theme, however, you may use any directory conventions you prefer. If you plan to use customized paths or <abbr title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</abbr> links in your template, it's best to create a setting in your `Theme.cfc` which will then be configured through the admin.
