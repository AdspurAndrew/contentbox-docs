# Front End Development

In developing your front-end user interface, the majority of your time will be spent creating content in the admin and within the `[ContentBox Module Home]/themes` directory.  

With state-of-the art development tools like [CommandBox](http://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/content/) to assist with scaffolding and dependency management and [Coldbox Elixr](https://github.com/ColdBox/elixir/wiki), it's easy to build out your theme in a fraction of the time it might otherwise take.   

In addition, many front-end focused modules and libraries are available on Forgebox and can be quickly installed from the [CommandBox](http://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/content/) CLI and used immediately in your templates, widgets and views.

A typical theme directory structure would be:

#### <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> MyAwesomeTheme

##### - <i class="fa fa-folder"></i> includes
  - <i class="fa fa-folder"></i> css
  - <i class="fa fa-folder"></i> fonts
  - <i class="fa fa-folder"></i> js

##### - <i class="fa fa-folder"></i> layouts
##### - <i class="fa fa-folder"></i> templates
##### - <i class="fa fa-folder"></i> views
##### - <i class="fa fa-folder"></i> widgets

On the next page, we'll discuss asset management and organization.
