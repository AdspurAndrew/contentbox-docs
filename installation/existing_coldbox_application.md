# Existing ColdBox Application

If you already have a ColdBox application and you wish to install ContentBox into it, you most definitely can.  There are a few more steps involved than our simple `box install contentbox` procedure as we will be integrating into an existing application.

## System Requirements
Please note that ContentBox 3 requires ColdBox 4.2+.

## Step 1 : Dependencies
Before we go and install the ContentBox modules we must make sure our ColdBox application has the right dependencies for ContentBox to work.  Please make sure you download and install CommandBox as we will use it for dependency management.
