# Source Installation

In this section you will install ContentBox by using the **source** download option.

# Step 1: Download Source
The first step is for you to download ContentBox (http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/contentbox) or you can use the command below:

```
# stable
wget http://stg.ortussolutions.com/parent/download/contentbox

# bleeding edge
wget http://stg.ortussolutions.com/parent/download/contentbox?version=be
```

Expand the archive into your web root or a sub folder:

```
unzip contentbox_{version}.zip 
```

> **Caution** Due to a bug in some CFML engines, DO NOT use the subfolder name `contentbox`, use cbox or site or whatever you like if you will be deploying under a subfolder.

## Step 2: Create Your Database
Now that the source is deployed in your webserver, it is time to create your database in your favorite DBMS engine.  ContentBox is built with Hibernate ORM technology, so in theory it should work in all major database systems. You can even use an embedded database like Apache or Hypersonic.

Make sure your database supports utf-8 or utf-16 character sets if you will be using multi-lingual or localization support.

## Step 3: Create A Datasource

You can now visit your application and will be presented with our datasource wizard.  You can either use our datasource wizard or you can create the datasource yourself manually.

Step 4: Run ContentBox Installer
â€‹

That's it! We are now ready to run the ContentBox installer.  So hit your webroot or the subfolder where you deployed ContentBox and let it spin for a bit.  ContentBox will automagically create all the necessary database tables, indexes and constraints for you.  After it does this, it will present you with our ContentBox installer, where you will fill in:

Administrator Account
Site Information
Notification Emails
Email Information
URL Rewriting
Enjoy your ContentBox installation!

 

We recommend that after you install ContentBox that you remove the installer and datsource wizard modules from disk.  You can do so manually or via the ContentBox administrator dashboard as you can see from the screenshot above.
